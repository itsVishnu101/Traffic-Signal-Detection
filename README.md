# 🚦 Traffic Signal Detection using OpenCV

This project is part of my **Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV)** coursework.  
The main objective is to detect traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green) using **Python and OpenCV**.  
Instead of using deep learning, this project focuses on **classical image processing techniques**, which makes the system lightweight and easy to understand.

## 📝 Introduction

Traffic signal detection is an important task in areas like driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent traffic monitoring.  
In this project, I implemented a basic traffic light detector that works on:

- Images  
- Video files  
- Live webcam feed  

The detector uses **HSV color segmentation**, **morphological filtering**, and **contour detection** to identify the signals.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
- **NumPy**


## 📊 Results
The project is able to detect:

Red signals

Yellow signals

Green signals

It works well in images and performs decently in real-time video depending on lighting conditions and background noise.

This project mainly focuses on understanding image processing fundamentals and not achieving perfect accuracy like deep learning models.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Some ideas for improving this project:

Train a YOLO / SSD / MobileNet model for higher accuracy

Build a custom traffic light dataset

Improve performance under low-light or high-glare conditions

Deploy as a web app or mobile app

Integrate with autonomous driving simulation tools
