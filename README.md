🚦 Traffic Signal Detection using OpenCV

📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) subject and aims to detect and recognize traffic signals using OpenCV. By leveraging image processing techniques, the system identifies traffic signals in images and real-time video streams, making it useful for autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems.

✨ Features

✅ Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and edge detection✅ Morphological Operations: Enhancing signal extraction and segmentation✅ Contour Detection: Identifying and filtering potential traffic signals✅ Feature Extraction & Recognition: Analyzing signal characteristics for classification✅ Real-Time Detection: Using OpenCV for dynamic video-based recognition

🛠️ Tech Stack

🔹 Programming Language: Python🔹 Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib🔹 Tools: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm/VS Code

🎯 Results

The system successfully detects and recognizes traffic signals. Example output:
